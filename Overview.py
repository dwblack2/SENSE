    Hallucinogenic substance use is widespread yet largely unsupervised, making it difficult to study in traditional clinical settings. To better understand 
    real-world experiences, RTI and NC State analyzed 29 million Reddit posts across 16 communities<sup>1</sup> discussing substances like psilocybin, LSD, 
    and ketamine. The Substance Effect Network and Sentiment Explorer Tool (SENSE) presents interactive dashboards that map reported effects and track user 
    sentiment over time.

    <h6> Substance Effect Network </h6>

    The Substance Effect Network maps user experiences with drugs by linking substances with their report effects. Positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI)
    offers a measure to compare the strengths of associations across substance-effect pairs. 

    <h6> Sentiment Explorer </h6>

    The Sentiment Explorer visualizes user sentiment of a given substance and changes over time. It provides an indication of whether user 
    experiences tend to become more positive, neutral, or remain the same with prolonged use.
